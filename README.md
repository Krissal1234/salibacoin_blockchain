# Rust Blockchain Learning Project

Welcome to my SalibaCoin project! This repository is part of my journey to learn Rust by building a fully functional blockchain system. This project aims to understand blockchain technology and delve deep into the Rust programming language, exploiting its features to create a secure and efficient decentralized network for the SalibaCoin cryptocurrency.

## Project Overview

This blockchain implementation will encapsulate core aspects of a traditional blockchain system, including:

- **Decentralized Network Setup:** Nodes in the network will function independently yet cohesively to maintain the blockchain.
- **Proof of Work Consensus:** Implements the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm to secure the network and validate new blocks.
- **Modular Consensus Options:** Architecture will support the flexibility to switch out the consensus algorithm, potentially integrating other methods like Proof of Stake (PoS) or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).
- **Transaction Management:** Ability to create, sign, and verify transactions within the blockchain network.

## Technologies Used
- **Rust:** The entire codebase is written in Rust, utilizing its safety features and concurrency support to enhance the blockchain's performance and reliability.
